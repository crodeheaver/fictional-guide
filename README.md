Example stacks:
- MERN
- MEAN
- LAMP
- WAMP
- Custom
  -  Vue.js
  -  Mongo
  -  Node
  -  Express

## Requirements
All POC should meet the requirements on this list.
- [ ] An awesome project name.
- [ ] Authenticated users
- [ ] rooms
- [ ] sockets (for realtime)
- [ ] SPA
- [ ] History
- [ ] private conversations/rooms (optional)
- **Must be submitted by May 20, 2016. Submit with PR**

## Ready, set, go.
Good luck.
