A set of guidelines to work with the POC projects.

## What? Why?
To compare and contrast technologies. You can use whatever stack you want, but it must be an end-to-end application.

My Stack:
- Mongo
- Ember
- Express
- Node
(MEEN)

## Requirements
All POC should meet the requirements on this list.
- [ ] An awesome project name.
- [ ] Authenticated users
- [ ] rooms
- [ ] sockets (for realtime)
- [ ] SPA
- [ ] History
- [ ] private conversations/rooms (optional)
- **Must be submitted by May 20, 2016. Submit with PR**

## Ready, set, go.
Good luck.
